## Research Goal
To visualize and quantify spatial RNA expression in large tissue samples to support tracking of therapeutic CAR Treg cells in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models.

## Methods Summary
- RNAscope in 3D: optimized probe penetration and signal preservation in whole-mount tissue.
- Tissue clearing: improved optical transparency using CUBIC/CLARITY-based methods.
- Light Sheet Microscopy (LSFM): imaged large cleared tissues with single-cell resolution.
- Image analysis: qualitative assessment of RNA localization patterns.

## Applications
This protocol enables non-destructive, 3D visualization of RNA targets in intact tissue â€” bridging spatial transcriptomics and cell therapy tracking.

## Future Work
- Integrate multiplexed RNA and protein detection.
- Adapt the workflow for spatial omics pipelines.
- Automate 3D quantification using AI image segmentation.
