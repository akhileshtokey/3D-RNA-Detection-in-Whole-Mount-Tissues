## Research Goal
To visualize and quantify spatial RNA expression in large tissue samples to support tracking of therapeutic CAR Treg cells in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models.

## Methods Summary
- RNAscope in 3D: optimized probe penetration and signal preservation in whole-mount tissue.
- Tissue clearing: improved optical transparency using BA-SDS/ WildDISCO based methods.
- Light Sheet Microscopy (LSFM): imaged large cleared tissues with single-cell resolution.
- Image analysis: qualitative assessment of RNA localization patterns.

## Applications
This protocol enables non-destructive, 3D visualization of RNA targets in intact tissue — bridging spatial transcriptomics and cell therapy tracking.
##  Data Used in This Demonstration

This repository uses **publicly available spatial transcriptomics data** from the 10x Genomics Visium platform to demonstrate analysis steps analogous to 3D RNA detection workflows.

- **Dataset:** Human Breast Cancer (FFPE) — Visium Spatial Gene Expression  
- **Source:** [10x Genomics Public Datasets](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/human-breast-cancer-ffpe-1-standard-1-3-0)  
- **License:** Open access for educational and non-commercial research use.

These data are used purely for illustration.  
In my MSc research, I developed methods for *RNAscope-based 3D RNA detection in whole-mount cleared tissues*, which this analysis conceptually parallels.


## Future Work
- Integrate multiplexed RNA and protein detection.
- Adapt the workflow for spatial omics pipelines.
- Automate 3D quantification using AI image segmentation.
