# Spatial Omics Starter: Tissue Microenvironment Miniâ€‘Study

A beginnerâ€‘friendly, **reproducible** project you can run endâ€‘toâ€‘end to explore spatial transcriptomics without prior ML or heavy coding.

## What this repo shows
- A clear, biologically motivated question
- Data provenance & ethics (public, properly cited)
- Reproducible analysis (Google Colab notebook)
- Clean repo structure, documentation, and figures
- Extensible roadmap (what you'd do next in a PhD)

> ðŸ§­ **Goal**: Map spatial patterns of immune and stromal markers in a public Visium dataset and relate them to histology regions.

## Quick start (no installs)
1. Open the Colab notebook: **`notebooks/Spatial_Omics_Colab.ipynb`** in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells topâ€‘toâ€‘bottom (instructions inside).
3. Export figures to `figures/` and summary tables to `results/`.
4. Commit & push to GitHub. Done!

## Biological question (example)
**How do immune markers (e.g., *PTPRC/CD45*, *MS4A1/CD20*, *CD3D*) coâ€‘localize with stromal markers (e.g., *COL1A1*, *ACTA2*) across histologyâ€‘defined regions?**

## Data
- Use a public 10x Visium demo dataset (H&E + raw counts) or another openly available spatial dataset.
- See **`data/README.md`** for exact links and how to download ethically.

## Methods (highâ€‘level)
- QC & filtering of spots
- Normalization & dimensionality reduction
- Clustering & spatial neighborhood analysis
- Region annotation (manual ROIs) and geneâ€‘set scores
- Simple differential expression between regions

## Outputs
- UMAP colored by clusters and marker scores (saved to `figures/`)
- Spatial feature plots on tissue image
- Table of top markers per cluster (saved to `results/`)
- Short report in `docs/report.md`

## Roadmap (what to add next)
- Multiâ€‘sample comparison (batch correction)
- Cellâ€‘type deconvolution using public singleâ€‘cell references
- Spatial autocorrelation metrics (Moran's I) and ligandâ€‘receptor analysis
- Benchmarking across tissues (brain, tumor, fibrotic lung)

Please cite original data sources (listed in `docs/references.bib`) and the tools you use (Scanpy/Seurat/Colab).
