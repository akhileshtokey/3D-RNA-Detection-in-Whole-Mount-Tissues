# Hi, I'm YOUR NAME ðŸ‘‹

**Spatial Omics & Translational Biology** â€” I explore how gene expression is organized in space within tissues.

- ðŸ”¬ Current focus: beginnerâ€‘friendly, reproducible spatial transcriptomics
- ðŸ§­ Project: [Spatial Omics Starter: Tissue Microenvironment Miniâ€‘Study](./) (see this repo)
- ðŸ“„ Report: [`docs/report.md`](docs/report.md)
- ðŸ“ˆ Figures and results update as I iterate

### Tech I use (learning by doing)
`Scanpy` Â· `Anndata` Â· `Python` Â· `Colab` Â· `Git`

### What I'm looking for
PhD opportunities where wetâ€‘lab meets computational spatial biology.

â€” _This profile shows reproducible science, data ethics, and clear documentation._
